Note Section 2:
1. When a client communicates with a server to transfer data, either from 
client to server (POST) or from server to client (GET), that communication happens
over HTTP.

Covered in section 2:
Used the Express.js app.post() method to create POST routes that accept incoming data from a client request.

Implemented middleware functionality provided by Express.js to turn our incoming POST data into JSON data.

Used Insomnia Core to test our POST requests while we wait for the zoo's front-end designer to give us client-side code.
